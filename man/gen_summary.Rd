\usage{
gen_summary(gen_dat, outcome, filter = 0, cont = F, rank = T, na_filter = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{gen_dat}{A matrix or dataframe, with samples as rows and features as columns.}

\item{outcome}{A leveled vector of length equal to the number of rows in gen_dat.}

\item{filter}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 (1 not included) that is the lower bound for the proportion of samples
having a genetic event (only for binary features). All features with an event rate lower than that value will be removed.
Default is 0 (all features included).}

\item{cont}{Should the outcome be treated as a continuous value. Default is FALSE treated as categorical.}

\item{rank}{Should the table returned be ordered by Pvalue. Boolean, default is T}

\item{na_filter}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 (1 not included) that is the upper bound for the proportion of missing
values in the features of the inputted gen_dat matrix. Variables that exceed this proportion of missing values will be removed.}
}
\value{
fits : a table of odds ratio and pvalues.

forest.plot : A forest plot of the top 10 hits.
}
\description{
Creates a summary table of the distribution of the genetic features by a specific outcome/covariate of interest. The difference
is tested using Fisher's exact test and further adjusted for multiple comparisons. Note that continuous genetic factors
are dichotomized at their median.

\examples{
library(gnomeR)
samples <- as.character(unique(mut$Tumor_Sample_Barcode))
## binary outcome ##
outcome <- as.character(clin.sample$Sample.Type[match(samples,clin.sample$Sample.Identifier)])
gen_dat <- create_gene_binary(samples = samples,mutation = mut)
## Continuous outcome ##
set.seed(1)
outcome <-  rnorm(n = nrow(gen_dat))
tab.out <- gen_summary(gen_dat = gen_dat,
                   outcome = outcome,
                   filter = 0.05,
