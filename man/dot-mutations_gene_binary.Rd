\usage{
.mutations_gene_binary(
  mutation,
  samples,
  mut_type,
  snp_only,
  include_silent,
  specify_panel,
  recode_aliases = recode_aliases
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation}{A data frame of mutations in the format of a maf file.}

\item{samples}{a character vector specifying which samples should be included in the resulting data frame.
Default is NULL is which case all samples with an alteration in the mutation, cna or fusions file will be used. If you specify
a vector of samples that contain samples not in any of the passed genomic data frames, 0's (or NAs when appropriate if specifying a panel) will be
returned for every column of that patient row.}

\item{mut_type}{The mutation type to be used. Options are "omit_germline", "somatic_only", "germline_only" or "all". Note "all" will
keep all mutations regardless of status (not recommended). Default is omit_germline which includes all somatic mutations, as well as any unknown mutation types (most of which are usually somatic)}

\item{snp_only}{Boolean to rather the genetics events to be kept only to be SNPs (insertions and deletions will be removed).
Default is FALSE.}

\item{include_silent}{Boolean to keep or remove all silent mutations. TRUE keeps, FALSE removes. Default is FALSE.}

\item{specify_panel}{a character vector of length 1 with panel id (see gnomeR::gene_panels for available panels), "impact", or "no", or a
data frame of \code{sample_id}-\code{panel_id} pairs specifying panels for which to insert NAs indicating that gene was not tested.
If a single panel id is passed, all genes that are not in that panel (see gnomeR::gene_panels) will be set to NA in results.
If \code{"impact"} passed, impact panel version will be inferred based on each sample_id and NA's annotated accordingly for each sample
If specific panel IDs passed, genes not tested in that panel will be should be considered. Default When TRUE NAs will fill the cells for genes
Default is "no" which returns data as is with no NA annotation.
If you wish to specify different panels for each sample, pass a data frame (with all samples included) with columns: \code{sample_id}, and \code{panel_id}. Each sample will be
annotated with NAs according to that specific panel.}

\item{recode_aliases}{boolean specifying if automated gene name alias matching should be done. Default is TRUE. When TRUE
the function will check for genes that may have more than 1 name in your data using the aliases im gnomeR::impact_gene_info alias column}
