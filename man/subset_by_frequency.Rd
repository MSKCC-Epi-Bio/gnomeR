\title{Subset a Binary Matrix By Alteration Frequency Threshold}
\usage{
subset_by_frequency(gene_binary, t = 0.1, other_vars = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_binary}{A \code{tbl_gene_binary} object with a row for each sample and column for each
alteration. Data frame must have a \code{sample_id} column and columns for each alteration
with values of 0, 1 or NA.}

\item{t}{Threshold value between 0 and 1 to subset by. Default is 10\% (.1).}

\item{other_vars}{One or more column names (quoted or unquoted) in data to be retained
in resulting data frame. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
a data frame with a \code{sample_id} column and columns for
alterations over the given prevalence threshold of \code{t}.
