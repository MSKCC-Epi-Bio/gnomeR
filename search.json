Added other_vars argument subset_by_frequency(), subset_by_panel(), summarize_by_gene() add_pathways() allow retention clinical vars using functions within pipeline. Deprecated count_pathways_by argument add_pathways() function. Now, user must specify specific alteration count towards pathway via .mut, .Amp, .Del, .fus suffix (e.g. custom_pathways = c('TP53.mut', 'APC.Del)).

Fixed bug add_pathways() custom_pathways wasn’t catching types alterations GENE.used due paste0() vectorization. Changed arguments strict matching (rlang::arg_match()) instead partial matching (match.arg()) (e.g. mut_type = \"s\" doesn’t work anymore must fully specified mut_type = \"somatic_only\").
